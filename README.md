> Status: OUTDATED‚ùå

<p>Custom Anki card made for language studies like english and others!</p>

<p>Just go to "cards for anki" folder, copy the code inside and do in the way described below.</p>

First of all, with anki open, you need to go to "tools", "manage note types", "fields", now you must create the properties:
<ol>
<strong><li>Sentence
        <li>Audio</li>
        <li>Meaning</li>
        <li>Synonyms</li>
        <li>Word</li>
        <li>Sentence-translation</li>
        <li>Word-translation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE: all properties must be in CapsLock</strong></p>

To apply the code, open anki, go to "tools", "manage note types", select the note you want to change and go to cards, just apply the front, back and style in their places.

The final design will look like this:
